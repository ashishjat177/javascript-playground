"**Another challenging project I worked on was enabling Localization in our product.

The business challenge was clear: we couldn’t expand into key markets like Germany, Russia, and China because our product was entirely in English, and these markets strongly preferred products in their native languages.

We started by doing a POC to decide whether we should build a localization framework from scratch—by maintaining key-value files for translations—or use a third-party library.

After careful analysis, we realized that building it in-house would take around 5–6 months, plus maintenance every quarter. On the other hand, using a library like Weglot would take 
around 20 days. So we chose the library approach to save time and effort.

After integrating Weglot, we faced several challenges:

        First, ensuring UX didn’t break—some components like modals, dropdowns, and buttons had layout issues with translated text.

        Second, PII data should not be translated or sent to external APIs, so we had to exclude sensitive data.

        Third, we had to ignore translating certain keywords or technical terms.

        Fourth, we needed to ensure search functionality worked across languages.

        Finally, we had to coordinate with multiple teams—engineering leads, project managers, designers, and QA—to handle their specific requirements.

One of my key learnings from my earlier roles & permissions project was not to take everything on myself. So for this project, I proactively raised dependencies with each team and assigned ownership 
for development and QA tasks. My role was primarily coordinating efforts, helping unblock technical challenges like search and dropdown issues, and ensuring alignment on design changes when needed.

We also launched the feature behind a feature flag to ensure a safe rollout.

The project was a big success—after launch, we were able to support multiple languages, enabling our expansion into new markets like Germany and Russia, which was a key business goal.

Overall, this project helped me improve my leadership skills, especially around cross-team coordination, risk management, and stakeholder communication."
